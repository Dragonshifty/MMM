# MMM
Minecraft Mod Manager

Written to essentially tidy up my daughter's desktop and take away all the faff of creating your own mod packs, forgetting where they are, getting the wrong version etc. So I've collated it all into one app. Please be aware that this is setup to copy file to the Minecraft folder on my machines. Also, the colours were a compromise over my daughter wanting everything bright pink.

If you wish to use the code then just change the 'mod_folder_location' variable. It's also setup to work from C:\MMM\ directory - which will need the relavant folders attached to it (Modpack, Backups, Optifine, Forge, Shaders, Skins, and Minecraft Mod version folders (labelled 1.12, 1.18.1 etc etc)).
